Hello,

I’ve been working in a cleanroom the past few months and am already very excited to switch up my work environment. I learned a pretty decent amount of Python on my own before getting my current job, so hopefully I haven’t picked up too many bad habits. The most recent show I’ve watched was “Stranger Things,” which was pretty entertaining.
