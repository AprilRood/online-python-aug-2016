//Arrays Day 1

//Push Front
//Given array and an additional value, insert this value at the beginning of the array.


//Pop Front
//Given array, remove and return the value at the beginning of the array.
//Do this without using any built-in array methods except pop().


//Insert At
//Given array, index, and additional value, insert the value into array at given index.
//You can think of PushFront(arr,val) as equivalent to InsertAt(arr,0,val).
