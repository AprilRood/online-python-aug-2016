Hello Everyone,

My name is Josh Keenan and I'm super excited to be learning my first stack!
I've always wanted to learn programming and now I'm taking my first steps in
changing my career from IT to Development. My favorite TV Show of all time is
Star Trek: The Next Generation, but recently I've been really into SyFy Channel's "Dark Matter". It's great!

Thanks!

-Josh
