#Online Python

Welcome everyone! This is a repository to help track our progress moving through the learning platform.

Your first assignment is to figure out how to send me a **pull request** that adds a directory (use your full name as the folder name) with an `aboutMe` file (feel free to make it a .txt or .md file) inside that describes your favorite current TV show.

For an example, take a look at the `CharlieMead` directory.

As we progress, we'll use this repository to submit and review assignments. You can track the schedule and solutions in the [Assignment Calendar](assignment_calendar.md).

Happy coding!
