Hi There,

Nice to meet you Charlie and thanks in advance for all of your hard work with our course/cohort.

My name is Tim Knab and my favorite TV show lately has been a show called, "Tiny House Nation". This show showcases "tiny houses" of all sorts of designs for all sorts of individuals. The types of people and the ammenties able to be afforded into a Tiny House is quite interesting. Along with the low overhead and monetary investment, these tiny homes have become quite interesting to me! How cool would it be to work remotely and spend time in beautiful places or closer to the people that are most imporant to our lives? This may be a long term goal, we'll see, but I highly recommend checking out this show for some interesting ideas and some cool inspiration!

Excited to learn Python! Let's do it!

Best in life,
Tim Knab
